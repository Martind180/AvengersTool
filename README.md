# Avengers Tool
<pre>
This tool was created originally to assist with performing and recording Codjumper
map Walkthroughs but expanded into a more general tool for all players.
This was based on a cloned version o Salty's CJOpenHud, 
huge shoutout to salty for providing this to the community.

## Current Features:
<pre>
Demoplayer (more info below)

Bind demo to load key (technically bind demo to F so I hope you use F for load position :D)

Copy current position to clipboard 
  - this is useful for players wanting to take a break mid performance and continue from where they left off. 
    Additionally F3 will execute /setviewpos [copiedPosition] allowing users to easily resume performing

Speedometer 
  - with 2 fonts, position and color manipulation

Position Markers
  - Assists with lining up for jumps during Walkthroughs by marking a position showing the player where to stand

## Demo Player
<pre>
Demoplayer was originally implemented by Wilhelm II to make editing walkthroughs much easier.

Demoplayer takes the inputs provided and executes all the demos one after another so they can be AFK recorded.
